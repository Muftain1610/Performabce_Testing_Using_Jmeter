# Introduction
This document shows performance tests on 6 frequently used APIs of a demo website "reqres.in", with load testing and stress testing.

# Load Testing
Load testing with 1250 concurrent users with 10 second of ramp up time.

**The total error rate is 0.32% and the total throughput is 296.4/sec.**
